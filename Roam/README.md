## Instructions for running Roam

### I am using Firebase which is installed via Pods, so to install the pods, cd into the project directory and run "pod install"

### Then once the pods have installed, open the project by opening Roam.xcworkspace and build the Roam project as normal

### NOTE: It may take a little while to properly index/build due to the thirdparty library "TLPhotoPicker" and it's dependencies, but it will build without error.
### NOTE 2: When running the app, images may take a little while to initially show up due to their size and how the app sets itself up, but once downloading no other issues should be noticed.

### You can log in to the app with a profile I've already created with "email: samsam@gmail.com password: samsam", or create your own account with a fake email/password.

### All buttons are operational at this time.

## BUGS: If you run into any errors, closing and restarting the app will fix it most likely. Don't switch tabs when uploading a post as this creates an issue (very rarely) that I haven't been able to pinpoint due to its rarity. The phone will vibrate and the image will go back to the default when it has uploaded.
