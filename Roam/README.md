## Instructions for running Roam

### I am using Firebase which is installed via Pods, so to install the pods, cd into the project directory and run "pod install"

### Then once the pods have installed, open the project by opening Roam.xcworkspace and build the Roam project as normal


### You can log in to the app with a profile I've already created with "email: samsam@gmail.com password: samsam", or create your own account with a fake email/password.

### The "Fav/Boomark" button is not yet opperational and there might still be a few little bugs/quirks you notice that I am still working on. Just wanted to get a functioning prototype up and running, quirks and design choices will be addressed for the final version,
